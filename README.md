## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MedTaha4Ever/MrcMS.git
cd MrcMS
```

2. Copy the environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Install PHP dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

4. Install JavaScript dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

5. Generate application key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Start the Docker environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

7. Run database migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

8. Seed the database with sample data (optional):
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

9. Build frontend assets:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use Docker, ensure you have MySQL and Redis running locally, then follow steps 1-5 and 7-9 above, and configure your [`.env`](./.env.example) file with your local database credentials.

### SQLite Setup (Recommended for Quick Testing)

For a simpler setup without Docker or MySQL, use SQLite:

```bash
# Configure for SQLite (simpler setup)
sed -i 's/DB_CONNECTION=mysql/DB_CONNECTION=sqlite/' .env
sed -i 's/DB_DATABASE=.*/DB_DATABASE=database.sqlite/' .env
touch database/database.sqlite

# Then run migrations and seeders
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

> üéØ **Note**: The current demo uses SQLite for simplicity and portability.

## Usage

### Accessing the Application
- **Main Application**: Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the rental management system
- **Admin Dashboard**: Navigate to `/admin` for administrative functions (default credentials: `test@example.com` / `password`)
- **Client Portal**: Browse available cars and make reservations through the main interface
- **Car Availability**: Check real-time car availability and pricing at `/cars/available`
- **phpMyAdmin**: Database management interface available at `http://localhost:8080` (when using Docker)

### Getting Started

1. **Explore Sample Data**: If you ran the database seeder, you'll have sample clients, cars, and reservations ready to explore
2. **Admin Functions**: Use the [admin panel](/admin) to manage vehicles, customers, and view reservations  
3. **Test Reservations**: Try the booking system by browsing [available cars](/cars/available) and making test reservations
4. **Development Mode**: Use `npm run dev` for hot-reloading during development

> üí° **Tip**: Start by exploring the [admin client management](/admin/clients) section to see the full CRUD functionality in action!
